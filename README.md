# The time it took you to perform the exercise
5h

# The parts that were difficult for you and why

I don't think it was difficult, it just took time. 
If I have to say something, it would be the curved movement. The final result is a little bit rough. 


# The parts you think you could do better and how

The movement and the camera. It can be smoother. I could also add more levels and elements, but I had no time left.


# What you would do if you could go a step further on this game

Add more levels, fix the camera/movement, add more damaging elements...


# What did you think

At first I thought it would be easy, but time could play against me. 


# Any comment you may have

If I had more time I know I would be able to improve this game significantly.
I am satisfied with the results, since I was able to add all the elements I had in mind while watching the demo: damaging elements, curved path, 3d model with movement animations, victory / defeat animations and progress bar. I had also time for implementing a raycast for the AI players, so they can stop if a damaging element is in front of them.
